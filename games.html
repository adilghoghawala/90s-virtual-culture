    <h2>How Games Structured Daily Life in Neopia</h2>
    <p>
        Neopets used an entire ecosystem of mini-games and “daily” activities
        to keep players coming back. From <strong>Ice Cream Machine</strong> to <strong>Meerca Chase</strong>,
        players could grind for Neopoints while also competing for high scores.
    </p>

    <p>
        There were also rituals like the <strong>Giant Omelette</strong>, <strong>Fruit Machine</strong>, and
        daily wheels. These mechanics made logging in feel like a routine:
        check your pets, spin the wheel, play a few games, restock your shop.

    <p>
        In my project, I connect these game loops to modern “live service” design:
        daily streaks, login rewards, and endless progression systems that show up
        in today’s mobile games and platforms.
