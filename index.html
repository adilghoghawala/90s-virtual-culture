        <h2>Welcome to Neopia (Introduction)</h2>

        <p>
            Launched in 1999, <em>Neopets</em> emerged at a pivotal moment when the internet was shifting from a largely
            informational medium into a space shaped by play, community building, and user-driven creativity. Unlike
            traditional children’s websites that offered isolated games or static content, Neopets presented a blended
            digital world combining virtual pets, competitive mini-games, thriving social forums, and an interconnected
            virtual economy. For many young users, Neopets served as their first sustained experience of managing
            responsibility online—feeding pets, participating in guilds, practicing digital communication, and
            navigating a marketplace of virtual goods.
        </p>

        <p>
            The early <em>New Features</em> logs—from November 2000 and January 2001—offer a rare snapshot of how
            quickly Neopets expanded. Weekly updates introduced new games, areas, items, and seasonal events, all of
            which encouraged returning players and reinforced the site’s identity as a constantly evolving world. These
            logs reveal a site experimenting with features that blurred the lines between game, community, and digital
            economy, hinting at structures that are now common in long-running online platforms.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tech historian Jay Hoffmann argues that Neopets “paved the road” toward modern metaverse models by
            introducing children to persistent avatars, customizable identity markers, and digital goods that carried
            value within the community. Hoffmann’s framing is useful not because Neopets resembles today’s immersive 3D
            platforms, but because it demonstrates how many foundational ideas—daily engagement loops, collectible
            items, social hubs—were already taking shape in 1999.
        </p>

        <p>
            This interpretation aligns with Sara M. Grimes’s research on “immersive advertising,” which describes how
            Neopets wove commercial cues and branded partnerships directly into gameplay. According to Grimes, the site
            normalized the idea that digital play and commercial logic can operate simultaneously, shaping how children
            learned to understand value, scarcity, and reward. Meanwhile, Jackie Marsh’s work on children’s online
            culture reveals how settings like Neopets allowed young players to “perform” identity, negotiate social
            norms, and engage in imaginative collaborative play.
        </p>

        <p>
            Taken together, these sources suggest that Neopets was far more than a collection of browser games. It was
            an early social playground where young internet users learned how to present themselves, collaborate with
            others, and participate in digital economies. This project examines Neopets through four interconnected
            themes: <strong>community structure</strong>, <strong>economic design</strong>, <strong>gameplay
                routines</strong>, and <strong>legacy</strong>. Viewing Neopets through these lenses reveals how a
            seemingly lighthearted virtual pet site introduced a generation to concepts and practices that now define
            digital life.

            <em>Note:</em> This project intentionally incorporates classic “Under Construction” GIFs and other retro
            design elements common to 1990s personal web pages. These graphics were a hallmark of early fan
            sites—including Neopets guild pages—and help recreate the Web 1.0 aesthetic central to this project’s
            historical lens.
