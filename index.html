    <h2>🐾 The Virtual World that Started it All (1999)</h2>
    <p>
        Neopets launched in 1999 and quickly became more than a simple virtual pet game…
        it was a chaotic mashup of forums, simulated economy, shops, roleplay, and kid-driven creativity.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Thesis:</strong> Neopets pioneered a hybrid online space that combined gaming,
    identity creation, and a user-driven economy, setting the stage for later kid-centered virtual worlds
    like Club Penguin and Roblox.</p>
