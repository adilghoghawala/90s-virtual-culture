        <h2>Welcome to Neopia</h2>

        <p>
            When Neopets launched in 1999, the internet was starting to shift from a place mostly used
            for reading information into a space built around interaction, creativity, and community.
            Instead of just offering a few random games, Neopets introduced an entire digital world
            centered around virtual pets, mini-games, social spaces, and a shared economy. For a lot
            of kids, this was their first real experience being responsible for something online —
            feeding pets, earning currency, joining guilds, and talking to other players around the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            The early <em>New Features</em> logs from November 2000 and January 2001 give a clear look at
            how fast the site was growing. New games, new worlds, seasonal events, and rare items were
            being added constantly. These updates encouraged players to keep checking back and made
            Neopets feel like it was always changing. Looking back now, these logs feel a lot like modern
            game update notes, showing how early Neopets was already using ideas we now associate with
            live online platforms.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tech writer Jay Hoffmann argues that Neopets helped pave the way toward what we now think of
            as the metaverse. Even though Neopets wasn’t a 3D world, it still taught kids how to exist in
            a shared digital space through persistent avatars, customizable identities, and virtual items
            that actually felt valuable. The importance of Neopets isn’t in how advanced it looked, but
            in how early it introduced these core ideas.
        </p>

        <p>
            This connects closely with Sara M. Grimes’s research on “immersive advertising,” which explains
            how Neopets blended play and marketing together inside the game world. Instead of separating
            ads from gameplay, Neopets built promotions, sponsored items, and branded events directly into
            the experience. At the same time, Jackie Marsh’s work shows how kids used spaces like Neopets to
            experiment with identity, social rules, and creative expression in ways that weren’t always
            possible offline.
        </p>

        <p>
            Together, these perspectives show that Neopets was much more than just a collection of browser
            games. It was one of the earliest large-scale social playgrounds on the internet, where young
            players learned how to communicate, collaborate, and participate in a digital economy. This
            project explores Neopets through four main themes: <strong>community</strong>,
            <strong>economy</strong>, <strong>daily gameplay routines</strong>, and
            <strong>long-term digital legacy</strong>. Through these lenses, Neopets becomes a key example
            of how early online worlds helped shape the way we interact online today.

            <em>Note:</em> This project intentionally includes classic “Under Construction” GIFs and other
            retro design elements commonly found on 1990s personal websites. These visuals were a huge part
            of early fan-made Neopets pages and Geocities sites, and they help recreate the Web 1.0 look and
            feel that this project is based on.
