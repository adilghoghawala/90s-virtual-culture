    <h2>Shops, Neopoints, and a Kid-Sized Economy</h2>
    <p>
        Neopets introduced millions of young players to a simplified version of an online economy.
        Players earned <strong>Neopoints</strong> from games, ran their own <strong>shops</strong>, watched prices
        on the Shop Wizard, and tried to grab rare items before anyone else. Even though the currency
        was fictional, the behaviors felt very real: saving, spending, hoarding, and sometimes
        regretting a terrible trade.
    </p>

    <p>
        Media scholar <strong>Sara M. Grimes</strong> describes Neopets as an example of
        <em>“immersive advertising”</em>, where games, branded items, and corporate sponsors are blended
        into the same world that kids are playing in. From that perspective, Neopoints are not just
        pretend money—they are part of a system that quietly teaches players how to move through
        a marketplace, notice brands, and think about value inside a game space.

    <h2>From Neopoints to Metaverse Money</h2>
    <p>
        Looking back, it’s easy to see how Neopets foreshadowed later digital economies.
        Tech writer <strong>Jay Hoffmann</strong> argues that Neopets helped pave the road to what we now
        call the <em>metaverse</em>, because it familiarized a whole generation with the idea that time
        spent online could directly translate into virtual wealth, status items, and social capital.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, similar ideas show up in games like <strong>Roblox</strong> and <strong>Fortnite</strong>, where
        in-game currency is often tied to real money. Compared to those systems, Neopets looks
        relatively harmless, but it still matters that so many kids’ first experience with “money”
        happened in a branded online world. This page of my project uses examples from the
        <em>New Features</em> logs and the Advent Calendar to show how Neopets slowly expanded its economy
        and made earning Neopoints feel like a daily routine.
