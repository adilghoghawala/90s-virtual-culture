**🎨 Full 90s Chaos: The Neopian Web Revival**

A COM 380 Final Project by Adil Ghoghawala

## 🕹️ Overview
Full 90s Chaos is a retro-styled, multi-page website that analyzes the early-2000s virtual world Neopets through the lenses of community, economy, daily gameplay loops, and long-term digital legacy. The project blends archival research, scholarly analysis, and intentionally chaotic 1990s web aesthetics to recreate the feel of early fan-made Neopets and Geocities webpages.

## ✨ Project Goals
- Recreate the look and feel of late-1990s amateur web design.
- Analyze Neopets using scholarly and historical sources.
- Explore how early virtual worlds shaped identity, community, and economic behavior.
- Connect Neopets to modern digital platforms (Club Penguin, Roblox, Fortnite, etc.).
- Demonstrate thoughtful engagement with both primary web artifacts and academic arguments.

## Reflection 
This project explores how early virtual worlds shaped children's digital literacy, economic behavior, and socialization long before modern social media. Recreating the aesthetic of the era adds an experiential layer, showing how design, community, and commercial techniques worked together in Neopets. Combining archival material, academic sources, and period-accurate web design highlights the early internet as a cultural space, not just a technological one.
