    <h2>From Neopets to Club Penguin and Beyond</h2>
    <p>
        Neopets helped define what an online “world” could look like for younger
        users: cute art, light roleplay, a safe-ish chat system, and a strong
        sense of place. Later platforms, like <strong>Club Penguin</strong>, took these ideas
        and simplified them into walkable spaces, emotes, and real-time chat.
    </p>

    <p>
        Many design patterns repeat: avatars as identity, virtual items as status,
        moderated spaces, and event-based updates. Today, we can see these same
        concepts in Roblox, Minecraft servers, and other large-scale social games.

        This final section of my project argues that Neopets functions as a
        “missing link” between chaotic 90s personal sites and the polished,
        platform-based social games we see today. It shows how 90s internet
        culture still echoes in the way we play and socialize online.
