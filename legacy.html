        <h2>From Neopets to Club Penguin, Roblox, and Beyond</h2>

        <p>
            From today’s perspective, Neopets looks like an early blueprint for many of the virtual
            worlds we use now. Even though it was built on simple web pages instead of real-time
            3D environments, Neopets introduced key ideas that still define digital platforms
            today. These include persistent avatars, virtual currencies, online communities, and
            frequent content updates.
        </p>

        <p>
            Jay Hoffmann argues that Neopets helped pave the road toward the modern idea of the
            metaverse. While Neopets wasn’t immersive in the way current games are, it taught kids
            how to exist inside a shared digital world. Players learned to customize identity,
            build friendships, and care about digital objects that held value only inside the
            platform.
        </p>

        <p>
            Club Penguin followed many of the same principles. Players controlled avatars, earned
            coins through mini-games, decorated igloos, and took part in seasonal events. These
            features closely mirrored Neopets, just in a more visually immersive environment.
            Later platforms like Roblox and Fortnite expanded on this same foundation, but tied
            virtual currencies directly to real money.
        </p>

        <p>
            Robux and V-Bucks function much like Neopoints, encouraging players to save up for
            special items and express identity through cosmetics. The big difference is that these
            modern systems are heavily monetized. However, the basic behaviors — grinding, saving,
            trading status for items — all existed in Neopets long before real money became part
            of the process.
        </p>

        <p>
            The research by Grimes and Marsh helps explain why Neopets fits into this larger history.
            Grimes shows how commercial systems were already embedded in play, while Marsh shows
            how kids were learning to socialize and form identity online. Hoffmann then connects
            these early patterns to what we now call the metaverse.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <em>New Features</em> logs and Advent Calendar archives show how experimental and
            fast-moving Neopets really was. The world was constantly changing, and players expected
            frequent updates. This expectation now exists across nearly every major online game
            and platform.
        </p>

        <p>
            Neopets may feel nostalgic today, but its influence is still visible everywhere — in
            how we customize avatars, earn virtual currency, and build online communities. It wasn’t
            just a kids’ game. It was one of the first spaces where millions of young users learned
            how to live online.
