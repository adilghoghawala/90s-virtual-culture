    <h2>Guilds, Forums, and Being “Someone” in Neopia</h2>
    <p>
        In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Neopets wasn’t just about feeding pets —
        it quietly functioned as an early social network for kids and teens.
        Players joined <strong>guilds</strong>, posted on <strong>forums</strong>, and wrote elaborate
        backstories for their pets and user profiles.
    </p>

    <p>
        Through these features, players experimented with usernames, signatures, and
        online personas long before Instagram bios and Discord servers existed.
        Neopets gave many users their first experience with
        <em>online identity</em> and community norms: welcoming messages, rules posts,
        and even drama inside guilds.

        For my analysis, I argue that these social tools made Neopets function as a
        kid-friendly social network wrapped in a game. The same basic idea shows
        up later in Club Penguin’s igloos, friend lists, and chat filters.
